# Introducing MDX

MDX is a superset of Markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your Markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.

For example, you could use MDX to create a blog post with a live code editor, or to embed a interactive chart.

Here is a simple example of an MDX blog post:

```js
import React from "react";

const HelloWorld = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
};

export default HelloWorld;
```
